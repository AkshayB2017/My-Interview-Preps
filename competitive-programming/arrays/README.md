### Competetive Programming
### Arrays
1. Program to find the length of the loop in a link list.
1. Program to find the missing element in an array containing numbers from 1 to n-1.
1. Program to find the subarray with given sum.
1. Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s.
1. Program to find the subarray having the largest sum(Kadane's algorithm)
1. Program to find the equilibrium point in an array.
1. Program to find the leaders in an array.
1. Program to find the minimum number of platforms in a station.
1. Given an array A and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.
1. Given an array arr[] of positive integers of size N. Reverse every sub-array of K group elements.
1. Given an array arr and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the K’th smallest element in the given array.
1. Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing height of blocks at index i as Ai where the width of each block is 1. Compute how much water can be trapped in between blocks after raining.
1. Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2.
1. Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
	1. Each student gets one packet.
	2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
1. The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.
1. Given an unsorted array of size N. Find the first element in array such that all of its left elements are smaller and all right elements to it are greater than it.
1. Given an array A (distinct elements) of size N. Rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion. The converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f. The relative order of elements is same in the output i.e you have to iterate on the original array only.
1. Given a sorted array A, size N, of integers; every element appears twice except for one. Find that element in linear time complexity and without using extra memory.
1. Given an input stream of n integers, find the kth largest element for each element in the stream.
1. Given two arrays A1[] and A2[] of size N and M respectively. The task is to sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as those in A2. For the elements not present in A2, append them at last in sorted order. It is also given that the number of elements in A2[] are smaller than or equal to number of elements in A1[] and A2[] has all distinct elements.
1. Given a matrix mat[][] of size M*N. Traverse and print the matrix in spiral form.
1. Given an array A[] of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. That is elements that have higher frequency come first. If frequencies of two elements are same, then smaller number comes first.
1. Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them in such a manner that they form the largest number possible.The result is going to be very large, hence return the result in the form of a string.
1. Given an array of 0's and 1's your task is to complete the function maxLen which returns size of the largest sub array with equal number of 0's and 1's .The function maxLen takes 2 arguments. The first argument is the array A[] and second argument is the size 'N' of the array A[] .
1. Given a link list, write a program to find the nth element from the end of the link list.
1. Given two sorted arrays P[] and Q[] in non-decreasing order with size X and Y. The task is to merge the two sorted arrays into one sorted array (in non-decreasing order).
1. Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's ,which is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. You have to find  the count of all the 0's.
1. Given a sequence A of size N, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence from a given sequence .
1. Given an expression string exp. Examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp.
1. Given an array with n distinct elements, convert the given array to a reduced form where all elements are in range from 0 to n-1. The order of elements is same, i.e., 0 is placed in place of smallest element, 1 is placed for second smallest element, … n-1 is placed for largest element.
1. Design a system that takes big URLs like “http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-sum-of-digits-in-numbers-from-1-to-n/” and converts them into a short 6 character URL. It is given that URLs are stored in database and every URL has an associated integer id.  So your program should take an integer id and generate a 6 character long URL.
