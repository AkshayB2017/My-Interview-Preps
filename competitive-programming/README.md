# My Interview Preps
### Competetive Programming
1. Program to find the length of the loop in a link list.
1. Program to find the missing element in an array containing numbers from 1 to n-1.
1. Program to find the subarray with given sum.
1. Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s.
1. Program to find the subarray having the largest sum(Kadane's algorithm)
1. Program to find the equilibrium point in an array.
1. Program to find the leaders in an array.
1. Program to find the minimum number of platforms in a station.
1. Given an array A and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.
1. Given an array arr[] of positive integers of size N. Reverse every sub-array of K group elements.
1. Given an array arr and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kâ€™th smallest element in the given array.
1. Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing height of blocks at index i as Ai where the width of each block is 1. Compute how much water can be trapped in between blocks after raining.
1. Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2.
1. Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
	1. Each student gets one packet.
	2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
1. The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.
1. Given an unsorted array of size N. Find the first element in array such that all of its left elements are smaller and all right elements to it are greater than it.
1. Given an array A (distinct elements) of size N. Rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion. The converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f. The relative order of elements is same in the output i.e you have to iterate on the original array only.
1. Given a sorted array A, size N, of integers; every element appears twice except for one. Find that element in linear time complexity and without using extra memory.
